These are the Scrimba challenges from the React course on scrimba.com - I also included a couple of other projects from Scrimba & a React homepage using the `src/components/Data/Data` file - I built to view all of the projects in an image grid.

---

### Add a Project

- Go to Projects folder present inside public `/public/Projects`.-. Create a folder with the project's name. For example `memegenerator`.
- Put all the files - html, css, js, images, etc. - inside this created folder.
- Make sure the html file is named `index.html`.
- After completing the project implementation take a screen shot or gif of the project and paste it inside the assets folder present inside public `pubic/assets`.
### View Added Project

- Go to `src/components/Data/Data.js` and paste the copied content at proper place and save it.

### Run the App

```javascript
npm i && npm start
```

- App will run on `http://localhost:3000`
